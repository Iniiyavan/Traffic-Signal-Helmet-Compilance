## 📝 Project Overview
The **Traffic Signal Helmet Compliance System** is an AI-based project designed to improve road safety and save lives.  
It uses real-time helmet detection at traffic signals to enforce compliance and prioritizes emergency vehicles by dynamically controlling traffic lights 🚦.  

It ensures:  
- Helmet enforcement for two-wheeler riders 🏍️  
- Green signal priority for ambulances & emergency vehicles 🚑  
- Accident risk reduction & improved safety 💡  

---

## ✨ Features
✅ Real-time helmet detection using AI/YOLO  
✅ Automatic red/green signal control  
✅ Priority passage for emergency vehicles  
✅ Big-screen alerts for traffic awareness  
✅ Reduces accident fatalities 🚨  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **AI/ML:** YOLO for helmet detection 🤖  
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Camera, Traffic Light Module 🎥🔴🟢  
- **Programming:** Python, OpenCV 💻  
- **IoT Integration:** Real-time signal control 🌐  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Connect Raspberry Pi with camera & traffic light system.  
2. Install required dependencies (Python, OpenCV, YOLO).  
3. Run the detection script to monitor live traffic.  
4. Observe automatic signal switching & emergency vehicle priority.
