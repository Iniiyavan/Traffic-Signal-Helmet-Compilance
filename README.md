# Traffic-Signal-Helmet-Compilance
The Traffic Signal Helmet Compliance System uses AI-powered helmet detection to enhance road safety. Cameras at traffic signals detect riders without helmets, keeping the signal red until compliance is ensured. It also prioritizes emergency vehicles by dynamically controlling signals, reducing accidents and saving lives.
